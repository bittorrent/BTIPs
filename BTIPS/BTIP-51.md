## Simple Summary

The BTFS now can store the file and we can retrieve the file by its cid, however, if we want to search for something related to the file, it will be difficult. For example, searching a file by its name or content would be impossible.

That would be awesome if we could add file metadata to the blockchain. Then we can gather all of the file's metadata in the blockchain.

## Motivation

This feature aims to help the file of BTFS to be searched more easily.
