## Simple Summary

## Abstract

Vault contract may support paying with TRX/USDT/USDD to satisfy more needs of the community and the renter can choose which kind of token to pay for the cheque.

When you have one or more of this three tokens(TRX/USDD/USDT) and do not want to convert the token to BTT, you can use the token you already have to pay for the uploaded file. And when host want to cash the vault, they must choose the tokens type of the renter sent.
