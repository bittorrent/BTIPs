## Simple Summary

Decentralized node score `calculation`

## Abstract

Nodes provide a consistent indicator collection interface for external services to collect required data and calculate node scores and rankings on demand.

## Motivation

The current node score calculation of BTFS rely on a centralized score calculation service, which is not transparent enough to the outside world. It is hoped that the node score calculation can be decentralized, and any node can participate and count and select nodes according to its own weight.
