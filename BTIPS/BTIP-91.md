## Simple Summary

This proposal aims to introduce a Proposal governance mechanism for the BTFS network. All processes including proposal submission, voting, and execution are implemented via smart contracts to enhance the automation and transparency of network governance.

## Abstract

This proposal suggests deploying a Proposal governance smart contract on the BTTC network, allowing community members to submit proposals, participate in voting, and automatically execute related actions based on voting results, all through the contract. This mechanism will automate the governance process on-chain and ensure the process is open and traceable.

## Motivation

Introducing a Proposal governance mechanism implemented by smart contracts brings the following advantages:

- All governance processes are automated without manual intervention
- Proposal, voting, and execution are fully transparent and traceable on-chain
- Lowers the threshold for governance and increases community participation
- Prevents tampering with the governance process and improves security

## Specification

## Rationale

The Proposal governance smart contract automates and makes transparent the governance process, enhancing the decentralized governance capability of the BTFS network.

## Backwards Compatibility

This new feature is backward-compatible and wonâ€™t cause breaking changes.

## Test Cases

## Implementation
