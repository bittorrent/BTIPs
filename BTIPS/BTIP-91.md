## Simple Summary

This proposal outlines a general approach to introducing a governance mechanism into the BTFS network. The process involves leveraging smart contracts to manage various aspects of governance, aiming to improve efficiency and transparency.

## Abstract

The idea is to use smart contract on the BTTC network that supports community-driven governance. This would allow members to submit ideas, engage in decision-making, and have outcomes enacted through automated means, all governed by predefined rules within the contract.

## Motivation

Adopting a smart contract-based governance model offers several benefits:

- Governance can be conducted with minimal manual oversight
- Processes are recorded on-chain, offering a degree of visibility

Moreover, this mechanism can also facilitate processes such as SP (Storage Provider) joining and exiting after approval, as well as handling other types of proposals in a unified governance framework.

## Specification

## Rationale

Utilizing a smart contract to handle governance tasks could streamline operations and support a more distributed decision-making process. With capabilities to manage SP approvals and other governance-related actions, the system becomes more adaptable and comprehensive.

## Backwards Compatibility

This new feature is backward-compatible and wonâ€™t cause breaking changes.

## Implementation
