## Simple Summary

In BTFS, sharing files with a CID is good and convenient. However, if we want to keep our file secret and then share it with somebody, it will be hard. Cause the CID is public and anyone who gets this CID will know the content related to it.

So we raise this issue to solve this problem.

## Motivation

This feature aims to help sharing files in BTFS to be more secret.
