## Simple Summary

Before BTFS v2.3.2, if we want to migrate our BTFS node, we need to stop our daemon, and then tar our .btfs directory. After we install a new BTFS node, copy the tar file we have done before and untar it into the .btfs directory in the new machine. It's error-prone and requires expertise. The person who doesn't know BTFS well won't know how to do this backup and recovery.

So, as mentioned above, we hope that some commands can help us to backup our node's data and recover it in another machine easily, such as:

``` shell
btfs backup -o ~/myfile.tar

btfs recovery  -r ~/myfile.tar -p ~/.btfs
```

## Abstract

BTFS should provide some kind of command to back up and recover BTFS data.

## Motivation

This BTIP can help the BTFS users back up the BTFS node's data and recover it in another machine easily.

## Specification

This BTIP will simplify the process of backup and recovery by providing the following commands:

```shell
btfs backup -o ~/myfile.tar

btfs recovery  -r ~/myfile.tar -p ~/.btfs
```

1. The `backup` command will back up the data of the current BTFS node, and option `-o` indicates the output file name and its path position. The output file will be tar archived.
2. The `recovery` command will recover the data from resource option `-r` and it should be an archived file probably generated by the `backup` command. And option `-p` will unarchive it into the .btfs or the path which indicates by env `BTFS_PATH` by default, so it is optional.

## Rationale

1. The `backup` will detect if `btfs daemon` is running avoid to the backup of the repo lock.
2. If btfs is running, `backup` will tell you to stop the btfs daemon process.
3. Or else `backup` will continue to proceed, now it will see if env `BTFS_PATH` exists.
4. If yes, view this env value as the target path, or not it will use `~/.btfs` as the default target path.
5. The `backup` will try to archive the target path above into the option `-o`; if it succeeds, `backup` is done.
6. The `recovery` will detect if btfs is inited(We recommend that you don't init btfs in the new machine if you want to recover it).
7. Also, `recovery` will judge if `btfs daemon` is running and do what `backup` will do.
8. If btfs is not inited, `recovery` will recover the archived file which is indicated by option `-r` into the btfs data path(env `BTFS_PATH` if it exists or `~/.btfs`).
