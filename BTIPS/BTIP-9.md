## Simple Summary

We will need a mechanism to get the exchange rates between WBTT and the other tokens(TRX/USDT/USDD) if we want to support multi-tokens.

## Abstract

TODO

## Motivation

If multi-tokens payment scheme is implemented, it is more prominent how the storage price of multi-currency is set.

It is assumed that the storage price of BTFS is fixed (xxx WBTT/G/Month), and the prices of other tokens are used as a reference and set to floating exchange rates with reference to the market situation. Then it is possible to calculate different token prices in comparative real time.
